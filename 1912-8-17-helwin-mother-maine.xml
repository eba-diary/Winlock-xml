               <persName ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma B. Andrews</persName> is best remembered
               for her association with the millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist/art and
               antiquities collector, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore M.
                  Davis</persName>. Traveling to <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName>
               with him between 1889 and 1912, she kept detailed journals of these voyages
               along the <name type="river" ref="#Nile">Nile</name>, including his important
               yet under-reported excavations of 20 significant tombs in the <placeName
                  ref="#Valley_of_the_Kings">Valley of the Kings</placeName>. <persName
                     ref="#Andrews_Emma_B">Emma</persName> provides a vital commentary on the
               archaeology and pioneering Egyptologists of the time. She paints a revealing
               picture of the lives of the colonial gentry and the cultural and scientific
               literati in <placeName ref="#Egypt">Egypt</placeName> at the dawn of the
               twentieth century. To date, her diaries are unpublished; analysis of the
               contents of 19 volumes will afford scholars and a general audience information
               about an important historical resource for the first time. Since its inception
               in 2010, the scope of our project has broadened to include the transcription and
               digitization of a wide range of primary historical material from the 'Golden
               Age' of Egyptian archaeology detailed in the Research section of this website.
               The Emma B. Andrews Diary Project is one of the founding partners of Newbook
               Digital Texts. We are proud to offer undergraduate and graduate Digital
               Humanities education and internships.</p>

         <p>Dearest <persName ref="#Chandler_Mrs">mother</persName>.</p> 
            <p>When I think what I have to tell
            you it nearly makes me cry but I am 
            so happy that I manage to refrain and 
            get sort of hysterical in consequence. The 
            point of it is that I am engaged to <persName ref="#Winlock_Herbert">Herbert</persName>
            and there is no doubt about it that we 
            each can make the other bubble with
            delight. I hope you like him. I think 
            he has changed a good deal in the 
            last four years so he probably has 
            a lot since he went to college </p> 
         <pb n="2"/> 
            <p>any way we seem to fit in together very 
            handily and the sun shines every day 
            even in cloudy weather. It makes me
            feel benign and delighted with everything 
            and please like him for my sake 
            even if you don't for his. However
            I have no reason to believe you dont 
            except that mother said you had
            picked out Paul who doubtless would 
            have done as well had the spark 
            been kindled but there's the rut. 
            Any way I am contented so is <persName ref="#Winlock_Herbert">Herbert</persName>
            which is the chief thing. Don't</p> 
            <pb n="3"/> <!-- sideways -->
            <p>tell any body till you see us as we have been waiting 
            to have it all out with you first. But before I finish 
            I must say that it changes everything from gloom 
            to glamor and I am what is known as radiant 
            and I love everybody and you one of the most. That is the hard part of it you
            just coming back after so long a time away and I on the point of leaving 
            but while we are together lets make the most of it. 
            It will be the best thing possible to have you back 
            again and the family are counting the moments.</p>
         <pb n="4"/> 
            <p>Its a big thing, what I am going to do 
            and I hadn't got quite settled in
            my mind about it yet except its the 
            only thing for me.</p> 
            <p>I am writing this at the Bruditchs. Mea sends her best. Mrs B. has had
            the ceiling lowered in this room so as
            not to offend your exquisite eyes for 
            proportion and we all will be waiting on
            the wharf to greet you. 1000 kisses 
            from <persName ref="@#Winlock_Helen">Helen</persName> your lovingest sister.
